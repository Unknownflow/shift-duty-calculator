# Project: Shift duty Calculator
This project was created as I wanted to calculate the night duty hours for each person and give a corresponding score. It takes in a Microsoft Excel sheet with the name and the night duty hours which each person does and returns a Microsoft Excel sheet with the name, the night duty hours and the corresponding score for the night duty hours. My aim was to monitor the night duty hours done by each person and to make a more fair night duty hour distribution for my section.
